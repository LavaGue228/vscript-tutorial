//    How to start vscripting?
//--------------------------------

/*
    At this point you should probably know
    that all the vscript files are
    in the scripts/vscript folder.

    To create a vscript, or Squirrel file, create a text file,
    then rename it to scriptname.nut, where scriptname is any text you want,
    put it in scripts/vscript
    and double-click the created file.

    If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed,
    open the file with notepad and be ready to suffer.

    If you do, you just have to install 
    following extensions: [extension].
    Then open the .nut file with VSCode.
    Currently this is the best way to vscript.

    So now you have a file.
    But do you have a knowledge?

    That's where this library comes in.
    You can still follow the order if you want to learn vscripting step-by-step,
    but you don't need to, if you already know something about vscripting.

    Remember: this is not a guide,
    but rather a lite version of the actual manual,
    with examples and a bit less confusing text.
