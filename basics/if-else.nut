/*
    If-Else statements are almost the same as in c++;
    the statement to check is surrounded with braces
    and the code after the statement is surrounded with curly braces.
*/
//  For example:

a <- True

if (a == True) {
    a = False
}
else {
    a = True
}

/*
    If-Else statements are the base of all programming languages.
    The concept is clear, you just need to use it correctly.
