a <- True

/*
If-Else statements are almost the same as in c++;
the statement to check is surrounded with braces
and the code after the statement is surrounded with curly braces.

In fact, they look...
*/
// ...like this:

if (a == True) {
    a = False
}
else {
    a = True
}

/*
If-Else is the base of all languages.
